# Hello-World
First try like everyone

So this is for noting ideas, if some floating ideas hit me.

Well now.
I had adventures with websites for quite a while now.
Let's say, the first actually mentionable was around 2012.
Since then I had several rebuilds of it and it now resides at *******

In october 2014 I did a course on HTML5 which I had to cancel midterm due to new work.
It wasn't that much of a loss as the concepts then where a bit behind the times (learning Flexbox after it's time).

I've used HTML first, then some CSS obviously, incorporated JavaScript later on.
After that I experimented with a little webapp called Digital Reporting, that sits on Sharepoints due to the environment it was developed in.

There I used JSON for the first time and started exploring SQL and other databases quickly prompting me to look into PHP.
It mostly started as a small idea to learn to use CSS grid in 2018.
As time for development got less and less, I had to leave it in a state I wasn't all that happy with. Last update was June 2019.

Now in 2020, I'll give it another shot and started a proper bootcamp - somehow that seems to be a common starting ground.
So, with the help of the app brewery, I hope to develop a comprehensive understanding and dive into parts of the backend as well.

Update on 2022: Well. I do understand MongoDB, Server, Express.js, Mongoose, Node.js. It's still pretty basic, but I'm getting there. Summer kept me from diving deeper as real life had quite a few surprises waiting for me. Time to get back into some coding again.
